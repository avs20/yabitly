I am able to insert into the cassandra database but the insertion has increased the processing time and decreased the throughput. 
it's taking around 5 sec to process one request and this is causing issue.

Now we should have fast insertion in the database and fast read also. 

I will mull over this problem later on how I can fast this up. 

Next issue is using redis cache.
